				LOL<br>

				A-BLE  (ey-buhl) adjective, a-bler, a-blest, noun<br>
				-adjective<br>
				1.<br>
				having necessary power, skill, resources, or qualifications; qualified.<br><br>


				COM-ICS<br>
				-noun<br>
				1.<br>
				comics, comic strips.<br><br>

				I've been thinking / trying to start a comic for some time now and have finally been able to do so.  You won't find any deep story-lines here, just a lot of random lol's.  Having a shit day?  Stop by for a laugh or two.  If you like it come back again sometime. <br><br>

				We also suggest you sign up for the site.  Now you're probably asking why.  Well, I'll tell you why.  Say you really like a comic, if you're logged in, you can rate the comics, than head down to the archive where you can sort by the rating you gave it (as well as overall ratings too), AND you get access to the forums.  There is also a twitter page so you can read my ramblings as well as get comic updates.<br><br>

				Incase you were wondering, when I say "we" I'm not referring to split personalities.  There is me (Kyle) the guy that's writing this about page and that makes the comics, and there is Dave.  Without Dave this comic would be hosted on Geocities, or perhaps Angelfire.  If you want to contact either of us check out the contact page.<br><br>

				Stick around, it'll be good times.<br>

				Kyle
